# rick_and_morty_test

Welcome to the Rick and Morty test

## Getting Started

First things first, at the start of the application you will find a completely functional Sign in/Sign out platform in where 
you can do the respective access process, there is also a Forgot password platform in the case that you
forgot your password (:v) completely functional too.

## Once You Enter

Once you login, you will find a welcome message with your username as sample about data persistence and at the right
is a completely functional logout button, right bellow you will see a listview with all the characters of the
Rick and Morty series.

And finally if you tap on some character description, you will be redirected to a screen with detailed information
about the character you choose.

## Principal Issues

The main issues in the application development was:

- The implementation of the search bar was pretty tricky, 'cause I can't find a way to make a refresh view without doing a fatal override
- The implementation of the random character tabs in the detail view was pretty tricky too and can't find a way to make it

## To Conclude

The test was a very interesting and challenging in some way, and actually I pretend to keep improve it with the knowledge
that I get and finally want to say thank you for the chance to prove myself.

Thanks for your attention.
