# rick_and_morty_test

Welcome to the Rick and Morty test

## Getting Started

First things first, at the start of the application you will find a completely functional Sign in/Sign out platform in where 
you can do the respective access process, there is also a Forgot password platform in the case that you
forgot your password (:v) completely functional too.

## Once You Enter

Once you login, you will find a welcome message with your username as sample about data persistence and at the right
is a completely functional logout button, right bellow you will see a listview with all the characters of the
Rick and Morty series.

And finally if you tap on some character description, you will be redirected to a screen with detailed information
about the character you choose.

## Principal Issues

The main issues in the application development was:

- Can't establish the way to put an image as a background for all the application within the "theme" properties.
- The API consume about the "episodes" part throw a multiple error series that even with the help of some other developers can't find a way to solve it

## To Conclude

The test has some missing parts about the episodes consuming/showing part, but the authentication system is completely functional
also was a very interesting and challenging prove my skills in witch I find some strengths and weakness in myself
and finally if you got to this part I just want to say "please, don't fire me, I promise to better and someone valuable to this company".

Thanks for your attention.
